## Separate the Editor from the Sidebar

This theme use contrast sparingly, which makes its application more effective. This method reduces visual noise while improving your ability to skim content efficiently. However, some design choices may not be to everyone's liking.

The separation of the editor and the sidebar, as well as the level of contrast, are frequently criticized. You can make this divide more visually distinct by customizing it. Simply copy and paste the following values into your user preferences. Feel free to customize the colors according on your needs. ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

# What's New

- The theme's codebase now uses TypeScript configuration files for each language and framework, making it much easier to maintain and update individual language styles.

# Development

To build the theme files from source (after making changes to the TypeScript configuration):

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will generate the latest theme JSON files in the `themes/` directory based on the TypeScript configs in `src/`.

# Publishing

To publish the theme to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace:

1. Make sure you have the [VSCE](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) tool installed:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   ```
2. Build the theme:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Publish:
   ```bash
   vsce publish
   ```
   Or use the npm script:
   ```bash
   npm run publish
   ```
