# Installation

1.  Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  Launch Visual Studio Code
3.  Choose **Extensions** from menu
4.  Search for `codeo`
5.  Click **Install** to install it
6.  Click **Reload** to reload the Code
7.  From the menu bar click: Code > Preferences > Color Theme > **Codeo**

## Disable Italics

If you wish to disable italics, there is now a no-italic theme available. You will have access to both, select **Codeo No Italics** as your color theme.

## Separate the Editor from the Sidebar

This theme uses contrast sparingly so that when it's applied, it's more meaningful. This can help reduce noise and improve your ability to scan. However, some of the decisions may not work for everyone. One such decision that some disagree on is whether or not to have a separation between the editor and sidebar, and the amount of contrast. If you wish for this to have more visual significance, please paste this into your user settings preferences. These are my recommendations for these settings but you can use whatever colors you wish. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
